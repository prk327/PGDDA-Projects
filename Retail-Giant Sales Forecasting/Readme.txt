Business Problem
Note: The deadline for this group case study is Dec 24 2016, 11:59 PM. The second
deadline, with 30% penalty is 3 Jan 2017.
Business understanding:
“Global Mart” is an online store super giant having worldwide operations. It takes orders and
delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories - consumer, corporate &
home office.
Now as a sales/operations manager, you want to finalise the plan for the next 6 months. So, you
want to forecast the sales and the demand for the next 6 months, that would help you manage the
revenue and inventory accordingly.
The store caters to 7 different market segments and in 3 major categories. You want to forecast at
this granular level, so you subset your data into 21 (7*3) buckets before analysing these data.
But not all of these 21 market buckets are important from the store’s point of view. So you need
to find out 5 most profitable (and consistent) segment from these 21 and forecast the sales and
demand for these segments.
